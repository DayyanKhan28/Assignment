    "OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. OOP focuses mainly on the working of Data and its handling, as only the objects of a class are allowed to access the attributes or function of a class.In OOP the whole program is divided among Attributes and Behaviors of objects.The data in OOP is protected in the form of Class and Objects.In OOP we can use the same name for performing different functions thus we can overload functions, constructors and operators in it.In OOP the data member of the class can be accessed through the member functions of the class. In OOP we can access data and functions of different classes between each other.\n"
